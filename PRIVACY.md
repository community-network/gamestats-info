## Data storage

we only cache request for
- 10 seconds for serverinfo
- 4 hours playername searches of stats request
- 1 hour for status arrays of games
- 10 minutes for everything else

This is to keep the amount of request lower, which are of course automatically removed.

we only save info of a user when he sets a username with the /bfsetme command for easier use of commands: "/bf1 stats pc me"
for that we added a command to unset the "me" option with /bfunsetme.

and we save "/bf_ recent" (_ == gamenumber) to show how many kills etc. you made in comparison to the previous time you used the command,
ask in our Discord if you want your user's bfrecent info removed.

all other info is gathered from the games or our manager: manager.gametools.network. 

The data is stored in a MongoDB database. The database is secured to prevent external access, however no guarantee is provided and the Bot owners assume no liability for the unintentional or malicious breach of Data. In the event of an unauthorised Data access, users will be notified through the Discord client application.
